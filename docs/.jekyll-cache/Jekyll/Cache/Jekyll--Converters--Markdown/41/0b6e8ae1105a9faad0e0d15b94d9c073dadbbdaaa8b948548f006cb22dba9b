<p>In 2017, we published our first open roadmap for Metasploit development. How did we do? For achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Metasploit data model backend: we did a lot of design work on this, and got a couple of initial Proof-of-Concept project built. You can see a video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvuy6A-ie1g. In the mean time, we started merging parts of the main development branch</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first pass of external session handling landed with the metasploit-proxy project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent modules that run in isolation <em>did</em> land, along with a hand full of new modules demonstrating the advantages of the design, including multi-language support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ruby_smb project made a lot of progress, with support incorporated into several existing modules. Full client-side support is also available for testing now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Native iOS and macOS support landed, along with many new IoT and router exploits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meterpreter shrank almost 4x thanks to the new cryptTLV packet obfuscation support, and the removal of OpenSSL.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Things we didnâ€™t quite finish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Metasploitâ€™s RESTful interface was not complete in 2017, so we will continue it into 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Session handling as a separate process was implemented with the https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-aggregator project, but more work needs to be done to improve scalability and usability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asynchronous session support remains on the drawing board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SOCKS5 support did not land, but Metasploit did gain a lot more support for running modules externally as separate processes, and gained initial support for running modules in Python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modernized payload generation with new tools continues to be researched.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
