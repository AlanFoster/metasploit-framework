I"Ñ<p>Metasploit Framework 5.0 has released!</p>

<p>Metasploit 5.0 brings many new features, including new database and automation APIs, evasion modules and libraries, language support, improved performance, and ease-of-use.</p>

<p>See the release announcement <a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/01/10/metasploit-framework-5-0-released">here</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a high-level overview of Metasploit 5.0â€™s features and capabilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Metasploit users can now run the PostgreSQL database by itself as a RESTful service, which allows for multiple Metasploit consoles and external tools to interact with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parallel processing of the database and regular <code class="highlighter-rouge">msfconsole</code> operations improves performance by offloading some bulk operations to the database service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A JSON-RPC API enables users to integrate Metasploit with additional tools and languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This release adds a common web service framework to expose both the database and the automation APIs; this framework supports advanced authentication and concurrent operations. Read more about how to set up and run these new services <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Metasploit-Web-Service">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds <code class="highlighter-rouge">evasion</code> module type and libraries to let users generate evasive payloads without having to install external tools. Read the research underpinning evasion modules <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/info/encapsulating-antivirus-av-evasion-techniques-in-metasploit-framework">here</a>. Rapid7â€™s first evasion modules are <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/10759">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">metashell</code> feature allows users to run background sessions and interact with shell sessions without needing to upgrade to a Meterpreter session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External modules add Metasploit support for Python and Go in addition to Ruby.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any module can target multiple hosts by setting RHOSTS to a range of IPs, or by referencing a hosts file with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">file://</code> option. Metasploit now treats RHOST and RHOSTS as identical options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An updated search mechanism improves Framework start time and removes database dependency.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
