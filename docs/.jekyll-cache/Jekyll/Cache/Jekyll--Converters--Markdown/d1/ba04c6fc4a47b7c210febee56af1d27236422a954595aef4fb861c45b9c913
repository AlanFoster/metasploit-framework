I"!<p>Congratulations! You managed to brave the storms of <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> and the dire straits of Ruby and submit a Pull Request. However, someone just closed it :(. This doesn’t have to mean the end of your contributing career. Below are some ways to keep moving after one of your PRs is closed.</p>

<h2 id="moved-to-the-attic">Moved to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">attic</code></h2>
<p>When we move something to the attic it means that what you submitted is a thing that we want but the circumstances were not quite right for landing it. Sometimes this is on us, and sometimes the contribution needs more work. We recognize that contributors work on the PRs they submit at their own pace. Take a look at the comments and review suggestions on your PR, and feel free to re-open it if and when you have time to work on it again. Don’t think you’ll be able to get it across the finish line? Find a community champion to do it for you.</p>

<h2 id="your-submitted-a-pr-from-your-master-branch">Your submitted a PR from your <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch</h2>
<p>Because of how GitHub tracks changes between branches and what got added in a particular PR, we don’t accept contributions from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch of your fork. All branches are <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions">required to be unique</a>. If your PR is closed because of this, create a new branch with that code and we’ll be happy to look at it again!</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout -b &lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;
git push &lt;your_fork_remote&gt; &lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This helps protect the process, ensure users are aware of commits on the branch being considered for merge, allows for a location for more commits to be offered without mingling with other contributor changes and allows contributors to make progress while a PR is still being reviewed.</p>
