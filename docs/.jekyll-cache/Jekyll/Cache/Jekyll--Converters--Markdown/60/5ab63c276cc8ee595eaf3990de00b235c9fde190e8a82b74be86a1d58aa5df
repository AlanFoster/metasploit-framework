I"ç<p><strong>Note:</strong> Final project proposals must be submitted through to Google through the GSoC Program Website, as stated in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/">rules</a>.</p>

<p>Before submitting to the GSoC website, it is also helpful to solicit proposal feedback via one of the contact methods found on https://metasploit.com/contribute. If you don‚Äôt hear back right away on a proposal, don‚Äôt give up! Contributors may be busy, or you may need to try again to get someone‚Äôs attention (but don‚Äôt spam).</p>

<p>When making your proposal, please include:</p>
