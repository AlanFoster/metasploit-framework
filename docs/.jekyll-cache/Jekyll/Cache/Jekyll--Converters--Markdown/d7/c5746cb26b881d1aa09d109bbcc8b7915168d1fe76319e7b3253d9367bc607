I"H<p>I’m yet to get the documentation done for this extension, but in the mean time there’s some useful information in the <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-payloads/pull/89">original payloads pull request</a> that shows how it can be used (including bindings).</p>

<p>I promise to get more detail here soon!</p>
